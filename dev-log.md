I am currently experimenting with different ways of providing diagram input reasonably easily. This is in order to be able to easily test various types of diagrams and spot any errors or inefficiencies with the renderer.

I have a reasonably well fleshed out renderer in place already but I'm never happy with it, so we can definitely expect some aspects of it to be reworked in the future.
