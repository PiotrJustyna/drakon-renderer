      * fork
      * switch
      * arrow loop
      * switch loop
      * for loop
      * wait loop
      * timer-driven fork
      * timer-driven switch
      * timer-driven arrow loop
      * timer-driven switch loop
      * timer-driven for loop

    * except
      * headline
      * address
      * begin of for loop
      * end of for loop
    * empty if equivalent to an empty operator (e.g. empty fork is an empty atom)
  * alpha-element
  * beta-element
* empty atoms are allowed for all stages of designing a drakon chart except for the last stage
* compound skewer block - a sequence of atoms
* a set of alpha-elements is obtained from the set of sequences of atoms by multiple application of the insert operation
